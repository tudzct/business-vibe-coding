# Flow baseline and assessment schema

## Frozen baseline

`docs/02-construction/implementation/<UC-ID>/flow-baseline.json` contains:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "artifact_type": "flow-baseline",
  "status": "Frozen",
  "uc_id": "UC-01",
  "use_case_path": "docs/01-inception/use-cases/uc-01-register-account.md",
  "use_case_sha256": "sha256:<64 hex>",
  "frozen_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "ordered_flow_ids": ["BF-1", "AF-1", "EF-1"],
  "counts": {"main": 1, "alternative": 1, "exception": 1, "total": 3},
  "flows": [{
    "flow_id": "BF-1",
    "type": "main",
    "title": "Basic Flow",
    "source_anchor": "Functional Use-Case Specification / Basic Flow",
    "branch_from_step": null,
    "terminal_outcome": "<observable completion outcome>",
    "steps": [{
      "step_id": "BF-1.1",
      "text": "<frozen step>",
      "completion_critical": true,
      "criticality_reason": "<why failure blocks completion>"
    }]
  }]
}
```

Types are `main`, `alternative`, and `exception`. Flow and step IDs are unique and source ordered. Explicit nested variants may use `UC-08.1/BF-1`; referenced “identical” flows are not copied.

## Assessment input

Configuration requires `flow_audit_rubric: completion-critical-flow-runtime-v2`. Assessment input requires integer `schema_version: 2` and the same `rubric_id`, nonempty `uc_id`, `run_id`, path-safe `assessment_id`, `stage: initial|final`, `source_revision` (full SHA-256), timezone-qualified `captured_at`, baseline `{path, sha256}`, `limitations`, `runtime`, `observations` and `flows`. Flows and steps match the baseline's exact ordered inventory. Each flow includes `flow_id`, `steps`, `terminal_outcome` and `completion_observation_id`. Each step includes its frozen `step_id`. Observation statuses are `met`, `unmet` and `not_evaluable`. The flow baseline uses schema 1.

All paths are repository-relative. A baseline reference uses `{path, sha256}`. All other runtime evidence must live under `docs/02-construction/implementation/<UC-ID>/runs/<RUN-ID>/flow-accuracy/evidence/<assessment-id>/`. The source revision is the stage's preserved full source SHA-256, not a Git branch name. Compare it against Source Gate/final source evidence before assessing. The deployment record must substantiate its association with running containers, including mounted source.

### Runtime object

`runtime` is required even when no flow can run:

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `status` | `ready`, `BLOCKED`, or `unverified`. Only `ready` with verified deployment supports runtime verdicts. |
| `compose_version` | Integer 2. No native host fallback. |
| `reason` | Nonempty observed readiness/blocker explanation. |
| `compose_project` | Nonempty project name for ready runtime; null allowed otherwise. |
| `services` | For ready runtime, nonempty array of `{name, container_id, image_id, state}` with observed values. Include relevant FE/BE/MySQL services. Empty allowed when blocked. |
| `deployment` | `{source_revision, verified, evidence}`. `verified` is Boolean. Evidence is nonempty and assessment-scoped (`observation_id: null`), kind `deployment` or `limitation`. Ready requires actual deployment evidence. |

`limitations` is an array of `{category, affected_targets, reason, impact}`; all values are nonempty strings. Category is `application`, `environment`, `missing_evidence`, or `ambiguous_cause`. Empty is valid only when no limitations exist. Explain unavailable observations and their scoring impact here and in target rationales.

### Observations and actions

`observations` is an array (empty when no attempt is possible). Each element has:

- Unique path-safe `observation_id`, plus exact `uc_id`, `run_id`, `stage`, `source_revision`, `baseline` reference and a frozen `flow_id`.
- `planned_at`, `started_at`, `ended_at` with timezone; plan precedes start, end follows start and does not exceed assessment `captured_at`.
- Positive integer `time_limit_seconds` and nonempty `scope`, declared before observation; actual duration cannot exceed the limit.
- Nonempty `actual_preconditions`, `entry_point`, `end_state`; `entry_kind` is `ui`, `api`, or `other`, derived from the frozen specification.
- `state`: `completed`, `incomplete`, or `blocked`. Completed means the connected attempt reached the terminal observation, not that the scored behavior is necessarily correct.
- Nonempty `actions`, chronologically ordered. Each has consecutive integer `sequence` starting at 1, `at` timestamp within the attempt, nonempty `action` and `actual_result`, nonempty `target_ids`, and nonempty behavioral `evidence`.

Action/evidence target IDs are frozen step IDs (including a necessary shared main-flow prefix) or audit markers `entry`, `branch`, `terminal_outcome`. Markers are evidence links, never new scored steps. Evidence attached to an action must cover its target IDs. The first action covers `entry` (with UI evidence for UI-entry flows). A completed attempt's last action covers `terminal_outcome`; Alternative/Exception completion also requires an actual `branch` observation. The reviewer checks the correct prefix and condition against the frozen branch, not merely marker presence.

### Evidence reference

Every non-baseline runtime evidence reference has:

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `path`, `sha256` | Existing assessment-local artifact and exact SHA-256 of its sanitized bytes. |
| `kind` | Behavioral: `ui`, `network`, `backend`, `data`, `runtime_trace`. Static/diagnostic: `source`, `build`, `health`, `deployment`, `limitation`. |
| `source_revision` | Exact audited revision. |
| `sanitized` | Boolean true; the author must actually sanitize content before persistence. |
| `locator` | Nonempty page/line/event/region locator explaining where to inspect the claim. |
| `observation_id` | Exact attempt ID for behavioral evidence; null for static evidence. |
| `flow_id`, `captured_at`, `target_ids` | Required for behavioral evidence; flow matches attempt, timestamp is within its interval, target IDs identify supported behavior. |
| `provenance` | Required for `source`: `{path, locator}` points to original repo source and original lines/region. The artifact is an immutable snapshot/excerpt, not that mutable original file. |
| `absence` | When claiming no request: `{scope, capture_method, started_at, ended_at}` on network evidence, within the attempt. Describe the target filter and capture window spanning the relevant action; missing logs alone are insufficient. |

Behavioral artifacts live below `<assessment-id>/<observation-id>/`. Repeat an identical reference in the action and the corresponding target decision, so the validator can resolve them. Do not mix attempts to construct a completion. Static artifacts may live below `_source` or `_runtime`; build/health are never substitutes for behavioral evidence. Content review remains mandatory: a matching checksum or `sanitized: true` is not semantic verification.

### Step and terminal decisions

Each retains `status`, nonempty `rationale`, nonempty `evidence` and adds `source_findings` (array, possibly empty). Each source finding is `{finding, limits, evidence}` with nonempty text and immutable `source` references. This finding array never drives scoring by itself.

For a critical step or terminal outcome with `status: "met"`, also require:

- `observation_id`: the matching verified runtime attempt;
- `required_runtime_kinds`: nonempty array drawn from behavioral kinds, chosen from the frozen behavior;
- `evidence_requirement_rationale`: nonempty explanation tying those kinds to the original requirement;
- target-specific evidence of every declared required kind from that same attempt, also present in its action sequence.

The validator rejects unsupported critical/outcome `met`; it never silently rewrites the status. UI, network and storage needs depend on the frozen step/outcome. The author/reviewer must reject omitted required kinds, mislabeled static output or incorrect entry kind even if syntactically valid. Source-only `unmet` can document a clear missing implementation, explicitly labeled static. Unreached steps are unknown, not inferred failures.

Each flow adds `completion_observation_id` (null if unavailable). `correct` requires this ID to resolve to a completed attempt used by all its critical/outcome `met` decisions. Fragmented proof across attempts without that chain yields `not_evaluable` unless a blocking failure establishes `incorrect`. Invalid non-null observation references are rejected. Noncritical discrepancies do not automatically fail the flow. Formula, equal weights, coverage, null exact percentages for unknown flows and bounds remain unchanged.

### Persistence and validation

The canonical `flow_accuracy` block uses the same schema/rubric pair as the input. Results include that pair explicitly and retain the complete input. Scorer dry-run performs identity, configuration/checksum, rubric, history, evidence and scoring validation without writes. Persistence is append-only: same ID and identical input/result can retry; changed content or existing artifact conflicts fail. Existing initial JSON/Markdown is never replaced. Aggregation revalidates all runtime evidence and recomputes scores before accepting stored results.

Initial/final share baseline and rubric. Repair automatically creates final evidence before its work turn ends: fresh stage-specific observations captured after prior assessment completion, distinct observation IDs and its own evidence directory. Runtime-blocked final records fresh limitations rather than copying initial success. When repair is skipped and the audited source hash is unchanged, retain the initial assessment as terminal evidence with its original stage/ID/time, equal initial/final BR snapshots and a recorded `repair_skip_reason`. Do not fabricate another assessment or require a separate Final Audit Gate. Terminal aggregation checks the source revision against the final BR/source hash.

The canonical `flow_accuracy` block requires `selection_policy: accepted-audit-results-v1` and `current_summary`. The scorer writes immutable `flow-accuracy/<assessment-id>.{json,md}` and stores the accepted result and follow-ups directly in canonical JSON. See [follow-up measurement](follow-up-measurement.md). Configuration, activation and evidence remain checksum-linked. `audit_design.protocol` assigns auditors (`fixed`, `matched`, `cross`); it is not a scoring rubric.
