# TypeORM 0.3 and MySQL rules

## Entity and repository

- Register every entity through the existing Nest/TypeORM configuration and give every entity a primary column.
- Map nullability, uniqueness, precision/scale, length, relation ownership and `onDelete` exactly from the configured DBML. Do not invent or broaden cascades.
- Inject the entity repository using established Nest patterns. Use repository/find options or QueryBuilder parameters, never SQL string interpolation.
- Map DTO fields explicitly. Do not pass untrusted request objects directly into `save`/`update`.
- Scope owned-resource queries by both resource identifier and authenticated owner identifier where possible.
- Select only required columns and constrain pagination, sort columns and relation loading.

## Transactions and concurrency

- Use a transaction when one business operation performs multiple dependent writes or state changes.
- Inside a TypeORM transaction use only the provided transactional entity manager/repositories, never the global manager/repository.
- Choose isolation, locking and idempotency only from explicit UC/Business Rule requirements. Handle duplicate/deadlock outcomes without exposing database errors.
- Keep `synchronize: false` and automatic migrations disabled in every environment. Do not generate/run migrations or schema synchronization. Entity edits map existing tables only.

## MySQL

- Preserve supplied database types and numeric precision; report incompatible requirements without changing the schema.
- Use existing constraints and required application enforcement. Missing necessary structure is an input blocker, not permission for DDL.
- Use existing indexes; never add, drop or change indexes during generation or repair.
- Keep timestamps/timezone semantics explicit and consistent with the API contract.
