name: resolve-figma-design-dataset
description: Create, refresh, validate, or resolve the repository's frozen, checksum-verifiable Figma design dataset for immutable UCs. Use when asked to build a full offline Figma dataset, when no dataset exists, and before prompt generation, source generation, frontend implementation, review, or audit whenever a UC may depend on Figma. Always source capture mappings from FIGMA-LINK-REVIEW.md; never call Figma with URLs or file keys taken from immutable UC files.

# Resolve Figma Design Dataset

Use the exact immutable dataset version supplied by the researcher or pinned by the active configuration/prompt. Always pass that version explicitly; never scan directories or auto-select a newest/default version. Copy the selected version and manifest checksum into every new configuration. Unreferenced versions are cold evidence.

Read the [shared execution timing protocol](../measure-uc-workflow/references/phase-ledger-schema.md). Resolve required Figma inputs before generation START. For a new blocker during generation, end the active core segment before resolution; do not reuse it to time resolver work. Resume a fresh execution segment only when generation is ready. Dataset-resolution-only turns, including missing-dataset blockers, use workflow-only token label `dataset_resolution`; they contribute no generation/workflow execution seconds. Mixed turns keep one primary token label under selection-schema.md. Common dataset setup outside the UC is recorded separately. Do not run Measure here.

## Create or refresh

1. Read `docs/00-context/FIGMA-LINK-REVIEW.md` before any Figma call. Treat its `Replacement URL` column as the sole capture authority.
2. Ignore all Figma URLs and file keys inside `docs/01-inception/use-cases/uc-*.md`; they are provenance-only and may point to inaccessible files.
3. Validate that the review contains one approved replacement or `NOT_APPLICABLE` for every file in the active project's frozen UC inventory. Stop if any placeholder, conflict or missing mapping remains.
4. Deduplicate by exact file key plus node ID, then capture each unique node once through the installed Figma plugin.
5. Require every artifact in `resource/figma-design-dataset/CAPTURE-SPEC.md`. Within a new unfrozen dataset, deduplicate identical assets to one checksum-addressed canonical file referenced from asset maps. Never mutate an already frozen version.
6. Create a new immutable dataset version. Never revive or infer a deleted version and never overwrite a version used by an experiment.

## Resolve

1. Run `python3 -B .codex/skills/resolve-figma-design-dataset/scripts/resolve.py <UC-ID-or-path> --dataset-version <version>` from the repository root. Use the exact researcher-selected version before configuration and the pinned version afterward.
2. If status is `complete`, use only the returned local snapshot directory, require valid checksums, and verify `resource/figma-design-dataset/CAPTURE-SPEC.md` before implementation or audit.
3. If status is `no-design`, record that no design is applicable; do not invent a mapping.
4. If status is `partial-content` or `pending-rate-limit`, stop design-dependent generation and report the exact missing capture state. Refresh through the installed Figma plugin using the approved review mapping; do not fall back to a UC link.
5. Treat two UCs mapped to one node as deliberate shared evidence. Never duplicate or mutate a snapshot per UC.

## Integrity and refresh

Run `python3 -B .codex/skills/resolve-figma-design-dataset/scripts/resolve.py --validate-all --dataset-version <version>` after capture or before a research run. A refresh creates a new dataset version; do not overwrite evidence already used by an experiment. Never commit short-lived Figma asset URLs, credentials, or guessed metadata.
