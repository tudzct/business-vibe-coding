# React Router, Axios and state rules

## React Router 7

- Preserve the project's declarative React Router v7 mode and central route definition under `src/router`.
- Use `Link`/`NavLink` for navigation and `useNavigate` for imperative transitions after an event; do not assign `window.location` for internal routes.
- Keep route paths stable and constants centralized when already established. Validate/encode dynamic path and query values.
- Use nested/layout routes with `Outlet` when the parent layout is truly shared. Do not duplicate authorization logic in route components; server authorization remains authoritative.

## Axios 1.x

- Use one configured Axios instance with typed request/response functions in `src/api`.
- Centralize base URL, safe headers and common response/401 behavior. Do not register interceptors repeatedly during component renders.
- Keep interceptor logging free of tokens, credentials and sensitive response bodies.
- Narrow errors with Axios helpers and map them to a stable, safe UI error model.
- Use `AbortController`/`signal` for cancellation; do not introduce deprecated `CancelToken`.

## Context and Zustand 4

- Use Context for low-frequency cross-tree dependencies such as auth/theme; split contexts that cause unrelated rerenders.
- Use Zustand only for genuinely shared client state. Export focused selector hooks instead of exposing the whole store everywhere.
- Keep actions next to state, update immutably, and avoid duplicating server-derived data across stores/components.
- Persist only explicitly approved non-sensitive state. Never persist passwords; persist tokens only according to the approved Prompt E design.
