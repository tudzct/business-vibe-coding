# Audit Generation Metrics

Read [FILE-DRIVEN-WORKFLOW.md](../../../docs/00-context/workflow/FILE-DRIVEN-WORKFLOW.md). A direct audit command authorizes first-pass audit with no Audit Gate or result confirmation. Require closed source telemetry and exact frozen baseline/configuration/source identity. During explicitly requested repair, this skill automatically verifies the final correction.

After initial BR/flow evidence is persisted and validated, run `advance-experiment-gate/scripts/record_command.py --run-json <canonical.json> --action audit --turn-id <actual-id>` (dry-run first) within the audit turn. It records first-pass completion and, if all BRs/flows pass on unchanged source, repair unnecessary. End with `finalize-workflow` when all pass, the repair command when defects exist, or missing verdict details when unknowns remain. Do not automatically repair or request result approval. Activation is optional.

When invoked inside an authorized repair, keep the caller's repair timer running through BR/flow/runtime verification and final evidence/hash/status persistence; the caller captures END afterward, before its response or a blocker wait. The whole turn retains token label `repair`. Do not open an overlapping audit/runtime timer. Standalone BR/flow audit remains outside generation and workflow execution time; never start a core timer for a standalone audit.

1. Preserve requested and effective model metadata separately; never infer unavailable telemetry.
2. Read the shared timing protocol. Audit-only turns use workflow-only token label `audit`. Audit does not capture generation time or extract live-turn tokens. Explicit measurement commands own canonical `metrics`; preserve that block byte-for-value when saving audit results.
3. Preserve the immutable initial assessment before any repair.
4. Assess every ordered BR exactly once as `met`, `unmet` or `not_evaluable`. Prompt text alone is not evidence; cite inspectable source, configuration, build or bounded runtime evidence.
5. In this same first-pass audit or authorized repair work turn, invoke `audit-flow-accuracy` for the same UC/run/source revision using the rubric resolved from checksum-pinned configuration. Read its per-flow procedure and schema. Runtime-v2 flow completion requires a connected observation of the integrated runtime; BR source evidence does not imply flow success. Reuse the frozen flow baseline and preserve initial evidence. Before returning from repair, automatically observe every flow on final source with fresh evidence under the same rubric. When repair is skipped and source remains unchanged, retain the initial flow assessment as the terminal observation, with its original stage/ID/time; preserve equal initial/final BR snapshots and record `repair_skip_reason`. Never fabricate a second observation or request a separate final-audit turn. Missing runtime/branch proof leaves the affected flow unknown unless a blocking defect is proven. Figma/UI accuracy is researcher-managed and must not be calculated or mutated here.
6. Append each repair with its model, affected BR IDs, evidence and references to its captured timing segment IDs/turn IDs. Measure records final token values in `metrics.turns` and links `repair_id` when a turn belongs to one repair. Do not split one turn among multiple repairs or invent per-repair tokens. Reassess affected rules without rewriting the initial snapshot.
7. Validate BR-ID equality, flow identity/totals, timing, tokens and final-source checksum using `scripts/calculate_metrics.py`.
8. Persist canonical JSON without overwriting canonical telemetry or researcher-managed UI fields. Print one combined BR/flow summary. Do not calculate a Business Rule acceptance percentage or invoke Excel export. Before returning from terminal work, freeze `business_rules.source_revision` and persist the evidence-backed terminal run status. The explicit `finalize-workflow` command then closes/skips Repair and finalizes totals atomically.

Do not create/run tests or claim unsupported business correctness.

When results are partial, preserve known metrics and offer researcher verdicts or continued bounded LLM measurement. Save either path with attribution and wait for `$bug-fixing-sub-prompt` if defects remain. Unknown accepted flows block new repair authorization. Accepted results use `accepted-audit-results-v1`; repair/source changes or inconclusive later attempts never erase conclusive verdicts. Keep runtime-v2 source/evidence requirements and original assessments immutable. Flow is supplementary to BR evaluation; optional UI scores never block commands. Do not export Excel or create/run tests.
