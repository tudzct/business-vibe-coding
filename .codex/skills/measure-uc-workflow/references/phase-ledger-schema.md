# Execution timing and phase protocol

Use `timing_method: system_timestamp_delta` with `timing_protocol: generation_execution_with_repair_audit_v2`. The AI invokes the helper at the following boundaries; the helper records the actual system instant and code calculates the delta. It does not infer readiness automatically. This is not UI Worked-for or full-turn latency.

| Execution | START | END |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt | After all required inputs, configuration, frozen resources and Figma resolution are ready; immediately before generating the Draft | Immediately after the complete Draft is persisted, before researcher review/approval |
| First-pass Source | After read-only preflight and prompt-close approval, immediately before the first source mutation | Immediately after complete first-pass source generation, before build, audit, runtime verification or repair |
| Each Repair | After defect selection, sub-prompt planning, required resolution and authorization; immediately before executing the correction | After correction, integrated BR/flow/runtime verification and final evidence/hash/status persistence, before responding or waiting for the researcher |

Never start a generation timer merely because a request arrived or a phase remains open. Configuration, approvals, missing-input/Figma resolution, standalone audit/runtime, finalization and reporting are outside execution intervals. For an unexpected blocker during execution, end the segment before resolution or researcher waiting; start a fresh segment only when generation resumes. Retain time already spent on actual failed execution; never exclude attempts merely for failing.

Resolve an available Python executable first; do not assume python/python3 is on PATH. Substitute it for <python-executable> (PowerShell: & '<absolute-python-path>' ...).

```text
<python-executable> .codex/skills/measure-uc-workflow/scripts/capture_timestamp.py --run-json <canonical.json> --session <rollout.jsonl> --turn-id <current-id> --phase prompt_generation --event start --segment-id prompt-001 --source-revision sha256:<actual-64-hex>
<python-executable> .codex/skills/measure-uc-workflow/scripts/capture_timestamp.py --run-json <canonical.json> --session <rollout.jsonl> --turn-id <current-id> --phase prompt_generation --event end --segment-id prompt-001 --source-revision sha256:<actual-64-hex>
```

For `--phase repair`, pass `--repair-id <canonical-repair-id>` on both endpoints and abandonment. Each repair has its own pair and ID matching `run.repairs[].repair_id`; resumed segments may share that repair ID but require unique segment IDs. Preserve failed/blocked repair records. Never reuse an interval for several repairs or invent per-repair token splits.

The helper obtains timezone-qualified `at` and `epoch_ms` from one local system instant. Raw identities include UC/run/session/turn/phase/segment/event/source revision, timing protocol and repair ID where applicable. Start/end revisions may differ; other identities must match. Never type, reuse or backfill endpoints. Duration is `(end.epoch_ms - start.epoch_ms)/1000`; ISO and epoch must agree within one second. Reject negative/overlapping intervals. End each segment in its own turn, before response completion or researcher waiting, including asynchronous approval. Tool/AI work inside an execution interval contributes elapsed seconds; never convert time into tokens.

The first core START opens that phase and binds `first_turn_id`. An open phase is a lifecycle window, not a continuously running timer. Auxiliary-only turns inside it do not start a core timer. If prerequisites block the first execution, retain `not_started`, report the blocker and do not fabricate successful phase closure. On the subsequent explicit close command, the telemetry engine runs in that measurement turn and closes the phase at that turn ID; later work cannot return to a closed phase. A reopened request requires a new run/explicit amendment protocol. Never execute different core phases or close a phase and perform new work in one turn.

If an earlier terminal/aborted turn lost its END, use `--event abandon --segment-id <unfinished-id> --reason <evidence-backed-reason>` in a later turn with current turn ID and original phase/repair ID. This records the missing endpoint and permits subsequent work without inventing an end. The original selected generation turn must retain `timing_unavailable_reason`; phase/workflow time remains null. Never abandon a running turn to evade measurement.

Repair automatically invokes BR/flow/runtime audit inside its execution interval and before its work response finishes. Capture END after the integrated verification and final evidence/hash/status persistence; never start an overlapping audit/runtime timer or count the same interval twice. If blocked, end before resolution or researcher waiting and resume unfinished correction/verification with a fresh segment for the same repair ID. Do not backfill endpoints. The subsequent `finalize-workflow` measurement closes or skips Repair and finalizes workflow telemetry in one excluded turn, without a separate audit or Repair-close command. No-repair completion uses existing initial evidence on unchanged source with the recorded decision.

## Aggregation and evidence

- Phase time sums only that phase's non-overlapping execution intervals. `metrics.repair_timing` records each canonical repair's seconds, segment IDs and missing-evidence reason. Missing repair endpoints make repair time unavailable, not zero.
- Workflow time = Prompt execution + first-pass Source execution + all Repair executions. Pending/missing phase time makes workflow time null; explicitly skipped repair contributes zero. This is not all workflow activity or first-to-last-message elapsed time.
- Auxiliary-only turns need no generation timestamps. Their counted generation seconds are zero with `timing_exclusion_reason`, not a claim of zero actual elapsed time. Optional auxiliary diagnostic captures remain raw evidence only, never included in phase/workflow seconds.
- Tokens cover whole turns: apply selection-schema.md to all UC work including setup/approval/dataset/audit-only turns. A turn with core execution must use that core token label, including repair's child audit; seconds still come only from actual core segments. Auxiliary-only turns remain workflow-only tokens. Every Measure/report-only turn is excluded from both metrics.

The Canonical Run JSON under `docs/04-experiments/<UC-ID>/` is a required pre-existing input and is distinct from the timestamp journal. Preflight never initializes it or the other three core inputs. After validation, the deterministic capture helper may create/append its runtime timestamp journal and generated view as measurement evidence; it does not recreate configuration inputs. Later measurement persists results in the existing canonical run. Whole-turn tokens retain this actual overhead.

`phase-ledger.json` is machine authority; `phase-ledger.md` is its generated view. Both live beside `workflow-metrics.json` in `docs/02-construction/implementation/<UC-ID>/runs/<RUN-ID>/`. The journal records timing protocol, phase state, segments and measurement boundaries. Canonical `metrics.phase_ledger` is the last committed snapshot. Writers lock the run and atomically replace individual files; canonical metrics commit first and mirrors recover from that snapshot. Closed observations and captured endpoints are immutable.

Prompt/source/repair remain buckets within the two phases. Runs follow FILE-DRIVEN-WORKFLOW.md and explicit close/audit/repair/finalize commands without additional gate confirmations. The repair invocation supplies its authorization turn and may record it within the correction turn. Follow-up measurement saves and waits for the subsequent repair request. Follow-ups never authorize repair. The helper checks internal receipts and ordering; source/telemetry-close turns never initiate correction. Preserve first-pass evidence unchanged.
