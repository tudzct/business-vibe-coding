# <UC-ID> Business Coding Prompt - <Use case name>

Both backend and frontend together must cover every specified Basic/Main, Alternative and Exception Flow and its terminal outcome; distribute these behaviors across Prompts A-D without changing the frozen functional scope.

## Prompt A: Backend API

### Objective: Build the API endpoint, business logic, validation, and server-side error handling.

Create the `[HTTP METHOD] [API PATH]` endpoint in `[BACKEND ENTRY POINT]`.

This endpoint MUST be `[PUBLIC / PROTECTED]`. If protected, use `[AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM]`.

### Request Format

`[REQUEST BODY / QUERY PARAMS / PATH PARAMS]`

Implement the main logic in `[BUSINESS LOGIC LOCATION]`.

### Logic

Implement the backend flow for `[USE CASE / API ID]`.

Implement backend and database behavior specified by the functional use-case flows, UML model, applicable API contract, and configured database contract, including applicable normalization, validation, authorization, persistence, transaction, concurrency, and sensitive-data handling.

### Success Response

`[SUCCESS RESPONSE]`

Wrap the domain payload in `{ "success": true, "message": "[MESSAGE]", "data": [DOMAIN PAYLOAD] }` without changing source-defined fields or message semantics.

### Error Handling

If `[ERROR CONDITION]`, return or throw `[ERROR TYPE / HTTP STATUS]` with `[ERROR RESPONSE]`.

Preserve the source status and message through `{ "success": false, "statusCode": [STATUS], "message": "[MESSAGE]", "timestamp": "[ISO-8601]", "path": "[API PATH]" }`.

Follow the existing project architecture. Do not introduce new architectural layers or dependencies.

Handle relevant ownership, transaction, concurrency, idempotency, date/timezone, and data-precision rules. Read the configured checksum-pinned DBML as the database contract. Map entities/queries to existing tables and exact column/key definitions. Allow authorized business DML only; never change schema/DBML/migration files, generate/run migrations or enable synchronization. Missing required structure is an input blocker.

## Prompt B: Frontend UI

### Objective: Build the user interface according to the Figma design.

Create `[COMPONENT NAME]` using `[FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES]`.

The component MUST display:

- `[UI ELEMENT 1]`
- `[UI ELEMENT 2]`
- `[UI ELEMENT 3]`
- `[...]`

### Figma Design Scope

Frozen Figma dataset and target: `[DATASET / FRAME / NODE / CHECKSUM or N/A]`

Use the checksum-valid frozen Figma dataset to identify all frames relevant to the active use case.

Determine relevant frames using the use case name, purpose, application-user actions, screen titles, visible UI text, and semantically related terms.

Record the exact names and node IDs of all identified target frames:

- `[IDENTIFIED FIGMA FRAME NAME AND NODE ID 1]`
- `[IDENTIFIED FIGMA FRAME NAME AND NODE ID 2]`
- `[...]`

If the relevant frames cannot be identified unambiguously, stop and report the matching candidates instead of selecting or inventing a frame.

### Implementation Requirements

STRICTLY follow the frozen Figma design at `[DATASET / FRAME / NODE / CHECKSUM]`.

Ensure the layout, spacing, typography, colors, components, states, and responsive behavior match the design.

Use the project's existing styling system and component conventions.

## Prompt C: Frontend Logic and API Integration

### Objective: Connect the frontend component to the API and implement the successful flow.

Continue working on `[COMPONENT NAME]`.

Add the required state using `[STATE / FORM MANAGEMENT APPROACH]`.

Implement the asynchronous function `[FUNCTION NAME]` to send a `[HTTP METHOD]` request to `[API PATH FROM PROMPT A]`.

### Request Payload

`[REQUEST PAYLOAD]`

Use the project's existing API client or request approach.

### Success Response

`[SUCCESS RESPONSE FROM PROMPT A]`

Read the domain payload from the normalized response data.

When successful:

1. `[SUCCESS ACTION 1]`
2. `[SUCCESS ACTION 2]`
3. `[UPDATE STATE / SESSION]`
4. `[NAVIGATE / REFRESH DATA]`

Preserve API request idempotency where applicable.

Normalize date/timezone and numeric values according to the API contract and existing project conventions.

## Prompt D: Validation and Error Handling

### Objective: Complete client-side validation, loading state, and API error handling.

Refine `[FUNCTION NAME]` in `[COMPONENT NAME]`.

### Loading State

When `[LOADING STATE]` is true:

- Disable `[SUBMIT BUTTON]`.
- Display `[SPINNER / LOADING TEXT]`.
- Prevent duplicate submissions.

### API Error

If the API returns `[STATUS / ERROR CONDITION]`:

- Display `[ERROR MESSAGE]`.
- Display the message at `[ERROR DISPLAY LOCATION]`.

### Client-Side Validation

Before calling the API, enforce client-side validation specified by the functional use-case flows and applicable UI/API contracts for `[USE CASE / API ID]`.

Display validation messages at `[VALIDATION MESSAGE LOCATION]`.

Backend validation remains authoritative.

Do not call the API when client-side validation fails.

## Prompt E: Business Rules Compliance

### Objective: Implement the complete frozen Business Rule set for this use case without changing its meaning.

One implementation control may enforce multiple rules when appropriate.

### Business Rule: `[BR-ID]`

- **Name:** `[rule name]`
- **Representation:** `OCL invariant | OCL precondition | OCL postcondition | natural language`
- **Expression / authoritative text:** `[verbatim Sheet-derived content]`
- **Context:** `[OCL context/class/operation or business scope]`
- **Enforcement layer:** `[frontend | backend | database | multiple]`
- **Failure behavior:** `[source-backed status/message/state, or unresolved]`
- **Traceability:** `[UC step/API/UI/source range]`

Preserve every Rule ID, OCL expression and authoritative natural-language constraint exactly.

Trace every Rule ID to its implementing controls without redefining the rule. Backend/database enforcement remains authoritative across trust boundaries; frontend enforcement is an additional user-experience control.

Do not invent missing thresholds, statuses, ownership, schema, enforcement layers or failure behavior.

## Prompt F: Implementation Context

Use every prompt present in this approved artifact together with:

- project rules and target manifests/lockfiles;
- database contract;
- API contract;
- Figma evidence when applicable;
- existing source-code conventions.

Priority:

1. Requirements explicitly present in this approved prompt
2. API and database/project contracts
3. Figma evidence
4. Existing source-code conventions
