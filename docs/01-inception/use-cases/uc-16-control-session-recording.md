# UC-16: Control Session Recording

## Functional Use-Case Specification

### Use Case ID

UC-16

### Use Case Name

Control Session Recording

### Description

As a host, I want to start and stop session recording so that the session can be captured through the visible recording controls.

### Actor(s)

Host; Recording Service.

### Priority

P1.

### Trigger

The host chooses a recording action from the session controls.

### Pre-Condition(s)

PRE-1: The host is viewing the joined-session interface.

### Post-Condition(s)

POST-1: The client displays the recording state returned by the system.

### Basic Flow

1. The host opens the recording control.
2. The client presents the recording confirmation shown by the design.
3. The host confirms the start action.
4. The client submits the recording-control request.
5. The system returns the recording representation.
6. The client displays the returned recording indicator and refreshes it from session state.

### Alternative Flow

AF-1:

6a. The host chooses to stop the active recording.
6b. The client submits the stop action and displays the returned stopped state.

### Exception Flow

EF-1:

5a. The recording service cannot complete the action.
5b. The client displays the returned recording failure state.

### Related API IDs

API-RECORDING-CONTROL.
API-SESSION-STATE.

### Notes

The shared model defines trusted context, persistence mapping, and query helpers. Server mutation execution uses MutationGateway and its common OCL constraints in UC-02. API command dispatch selects the named operation; it does not combine the preconditions of different operations. Read operations have no domain writes.

## UML Model

Local projection of exactly the vocabulary needed by the Business Rules below, including signature and helper types. Enum domains are retained in full to preserve their value semantics.

}
note right of String
Removes leading and trailing whitespace; internal whitespace is unchanged.
end note
note right of RequestContext
Request-local trusted adapter data; not a process-global singleton.
Principal and session are decoded from the authenticated session access token.
participantId resolves the principal's membership.
Provider callbacks use a separate authenticated adapter.
end note
note right of TransactionContext: Describes the database transaction for the current operation.
